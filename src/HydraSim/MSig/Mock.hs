-- Module: MSig.Mock
-- Description: Mock multi signatures
--
-- A mock implementation of the multi signature scheme in section 2.1 in the Hydra paper.
--
-- We choose a simple representation, where private and public keys, as well as
-- signature, are just numbers, and a signature by a key is considered valid iff
-- the numbers are the same (and extend this to sets of keys). Obviously, this is
-- not safe in any way, but for simulations, it is just fine, and makes for
-- readable traces.
--
-- We use 'Delayedcomp' to account for time that real cryptographic primitives
-- might take.
