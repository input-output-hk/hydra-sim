{- | A computation simulating the time needed to lookup a client in an in-memory registry.
 The value is taken from running benchmarks of the 'containers' Haskell library on a
 high-end laptop. The time needed to perform a lookup was deemed non negligeable in front of
 the time needed to validate a transaction.

 Note that a typical hashmap or map is implemented using balanced binary trees and provide a O(log(n))
 lookup performances, so the cost of looking a client in a map of 1000 or 100000 clients is _roughly the same_.

{- | Return 'f (Just ClientId)' iif a client would exceed (bottom or top) its payment window
 from the requested payment, or if it's already performing a snapshot.

 NOTE: There's a slight _abuse_ here. Transactions are indeed written from the PoV
 of the _sender_. So the amount corresponds to how much did the sender "lost" in the
 transaction, but, there can be multiple recipients! Irrespective of this, we consider
 in the simulation that *each* recipient receives the full amount.
